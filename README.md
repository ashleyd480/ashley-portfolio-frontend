# Overview

## Installation

When cloning the project for use- make sure to run `npm i` to install required React dependencies on your local machine. Also, you will want to run the following two lines, as my portfolio app uses react-router and react bootstrap:

```
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```
