          Here is a gallery that shows a preview of adhoc feedback that I have received from teammates
          as well as peers outside of the Boost team. Since my time at Indeed, I
          have kept a running Google Doc of positive feedback received. I
          treasure these kind words as they have brought me innumerable smiles,
          reminding me to give myself grace even at moments when I could only
          see mistakes in myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes even the simplest of words
          can bring the greatest joy to others. Thank you Indeedians for
          bringing such a supportive and warm environment. These kind words below are dated to the start of the BOOST program and onwards. üß°
