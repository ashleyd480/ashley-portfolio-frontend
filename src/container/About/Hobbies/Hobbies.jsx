        <h4>Local Guide</h4>

        <p>
          Google Maps: I have been a Local Guide üåç since 2016, currently at
          Level 10. I moderate incorrect information on local business listings,
          and add photos, videos, and review content to local businesses. When I
          overcome the gravitational forces of my couch, recently I find myself
          drawn to exploring historical and small cities, helping to bring
          awareness on Maps to smaller, lesser-known cities and businesses
          there. You can read more about the Local Guides program{" "}

          .
        </p>

        <h4>Connect</h4>
        <p>
          Connect is Google Map's online community for Local Guides and users. I
          initially found out about it when noting a bug with points in 2019. In
          2021, when I finally reached Level 10, I decided to share my{" "}

            path
          </a>{" "}
          getting there and how Google Maps helped impact me as well. I write
          articles to highlight local points of interest that I have helped add
          content at and create informative posts on best practices for using
          Maps on my blog{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.localguidesconnect.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1082631"

          >
            profile
          </a>
          . The warm reception of the community to my first article gave me the
          fuel to keep writing. Since then, I have authored articles to
          highlight local points of interest that I have helped add content at
          and create informative posts on best practices for using Maps.

          . What really drew me to the program is how the program seeks to make
          AI that is global and spans cultures by having multi-language
          activities to train the AI. Some of the activities I partook in were:

        <ul>
          <li>Process typing samples</li>
          <li>Verify image labels</li>
          <li>Audit English and Spanish pronunciation clips</li>
          <li>Voice narrate English and Spanish phrases</li>
